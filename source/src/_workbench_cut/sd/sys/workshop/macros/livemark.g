; livemark.g -- tells the service that a LIVE job starts (only when it is one).
; The last line of every material macro: M98 P"0:/sys/workshop/macros/livemark.g" N"<material name>"
; When the job is LIVE (a program sends it through the bridge: no file is running on the machine) it calls the job.start
; operation of the service (the service marks the job: jog and zones stay blocked, Activity logs it). When the job is a
; G-code file it does nothing. A macro cannot talk to the bridge with M118 (the bridge only reads what the program
; sends); it uses service-call.g like any other macro. Everything else a material needs stays in its own macro.
; N = name shown for the live job (optional)
; 2026-10-17: only when the material macro was sent by a program. The same macro run from the web page (HTTP channel: Measure and
; focus, a material button in the Mesa) is a preparation, not a job: it used to open a live job before any cutting started.
; 2026-10-18: if laserfocus.g did not reach its end (probe not triggered, BLTouch error...) the job must not go on: abort (cancels a file job, and the
; error of this macro makes the bridge refuse the rest of a live job).
