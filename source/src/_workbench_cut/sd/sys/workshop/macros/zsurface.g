; zsurface.g -- THICKNESS of the material (WorkshopJog, request 2026-10-09: "warn
; if the material is the wrong one before cutting"). Called RIGHT AFTER
; a G30 that measured a surface (laserfocus.g, focushere.g,
; zprobepoint.g, homezhere.g).
;
; How: global.workshopZBed = height of the BED in the current Z frame. It is
; set by zbedref.g at the Z homing (G30 on the bed: bed = 0). Each G30
; moves the zero to the measured surface; sensors.probes[0].lastStopHeight is
; where the probe stopped in the PREVIOUS frame, so:
;   surface (previous frame) = lastStopHeight - triggerHeight
;   thickness = surface - bed
;   bed in the new frame = bed - surface
; If the reference is not valid (no Z homing, G92 Z by hand, etc.)
; nothing is computed (global.workshopThickness = -1).
;
; Use:  M98 P"0:/sys/workshop/macros/zsurface.g" T3 N"MDF 3mm"
;   T = expected thickness in mm (optional; 0 = do not compare)
;   N = name of the material for the warning (optional)
;   K = 1: compare also without bed compensation (mesh); by default it is only compared with the mesh on
