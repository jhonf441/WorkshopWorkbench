; laserfocus.g
; Selects the origin of a material, MEASURES the surface of the material with the
; BLTouch and leaves the laser at the focus distance above that surface.
; So the height does not depend on what Z was homed on before
; (empty bed or another sheet thickness).
;
; Use:  M98 P"0:/sys/workshop/macros/laserfocus.g" W2 H7.5 N"MDF 3mm"
;   W = workplace: 1=G54 2=G55 3=G56 4=G57 5=G58 6=G59
;   H = focus distance in mm ABOVE the surface of the material. Optional if T is given: then it is
;       calculated from the thickness (focusrule.g: the maker table + the measured geometry)
;   N = name for the message (optional)
;   Q = 1: ask first whether there is material on the table (Cancel stops before moving)
;   T = expected thickness of the material in mm (optional): if the measurement does
;       not match, it asks before going on (see zsurface.g)
;   X Y = point where the probe touches, relative to the zero of the zone (optional,
;         X30 Y30 if missing). The Zones page writes it when the measuring point
;         is chosen on the map (request 2026-10-09).
